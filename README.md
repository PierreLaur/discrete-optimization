# Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization
My work on the course [Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/solving-algorithms-discrete-optimization/). A course about how Constraint Programming solvers work and how to create efficient models. Also includes an introduction to Local Search methods (Simulated Annealing, Discrete Lagrange Multipliers, Tabu Search, Large Neighborhood Search).  
Taught by Peter Stuckey & Jimmy Lee.
